Super simple ( and stupid ) floating point error propagation calculating type  
I dont guarantee that this is correct. If you know you can do something better just contribute! :)  
# why cgmath dependency?
Well. Because I am using cgmath library. and unfortunatelly to be able to use custom num type with cgmath you have to depend on them. :( Because they provide their own trait which has to be implemented.
